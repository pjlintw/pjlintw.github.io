Hi, I am an incoming PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) this Fall where I will be advised by [Tu Vu](https://tuvllms.github.io/). 

Previously, I received my Master's at the [Language Science and Technology Department (LST)](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/research.html) of Saarland University, where I worked with [Dietrich Klakow](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/people/dietrich-klakow/) and [Vera Demberg](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html). Prior to that, I contributed to the development of NLP system for historical archives with [Richard Tzong-Han Tsai](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=iDz3gJ4AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) at Intelligent Information Service Research Lab (IISR) and [Liu Yuan-ju](https://www.harvard-yenching.org/person/liu-yuan-ju/) at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. 

My primary research interests broadly revolve around efficient NLP which span a wide range of captivating topics including:

- Efficient transfer learning: [In-Context Prompt Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00895), [Open Prompt Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00897), [Sample Size Determination](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.419/), [LED](https://aclanthology.org/2022.creativesumm-1.9/).
- NLP for low-resource languages: [CaT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00382).

<!-- - Semantic space for task information encoding: [IIT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRGYOvBls695iaOWhuV_8bJoIKy1EUMy/view?usp=sharing). -->

<!-- These days, I’m excited about delving into the behavior of LMs — understanding how they learn and process information at different levels. Pertinent sub- questions arise, such as understanding the specific information transmitted through within-tuning phases and cross-tuning phases. Furthermore, exploring how LMs store information in their knowledge reservoirs and how they can selectively purge or forget knowledge from this reservoir.
