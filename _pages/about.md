I am a second year master's student at the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/research.html) of Saarland University where I work with [Ôº∞rof. Dr. Dietriech Klakow](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/people/dietrich-klakow/) and [Ôº∞rof. Dr. Vera Demberg](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html). Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Richard Tzong-Han Tsai](https://www.iisr.csie.ncu.edu.tw/faculty) and [Prof. Liu Yuan-ju](https://www.litphil.sinica.edu.tw/people/researchers/Liu,%20Yuan-ju) at National Central University and Academia Sinica, Taiwan. 

My current research interests broadly revolve around efficient NLP, especially:

- Parameter-efficient learning
- Conditional generation for low-resource languages
- Semantic space for task information encoding
